Validation of the Report
========================
**"NB:"** It is important to know that not every police officer has the authority to validate a report.

When you have the authorization, you will see on the declaration presentation interface some declarations with the status **"READY"**. To validate it, you must click on the **"Actions"** button and then click on **"Validation"** as follows:

Then click on **"Report Preview"**

Click on **"Validation"**

On the interface that will be displayed, you must make a decision based on the accident report. If it is necessary to reject the declaration, select **"Cancel"** and then provide a reason for the choice to ensure that the collecting officer is notified of the reason taken by their superior. The declaration status will then change to **"REJECTED"**. However, if the decision is to accept the declaration, you must select **"Accept"**, sign, optionally provide additional information, and confirm. The declaration status will change to **"ACCEPTED"**.

When the collecting officer completes the preparation of their declaration, the declaration status changes to "READY". If a sketch has been added, it changes to "READY Add". At this point, the senior collecting officer can review the declaration, review the report, validate the declaration, and cancel or delete the declaration.
