Insurance Management Procedure
==============================

Following the hospital's assumption of care, treatment, examinations, and trauma are immediately initiated. These data recorded at the hospital are made available to the insurer at time t, who will have the capability to accept or reject the coverage of a particular treatment or examination. As the insurance center is capable of evaluating the technical condition of a vehicle and producing a report, it will therefore be able, in the application, to:

    * Provide insurance contract data.
    * Identify various vehicle defects.
    * Manage the injured parties concerning the insured vehicle by validating the treatments and examinations to be covered.
    * Identify the vehicle and verify the insurance policy.
    * Manage the vehicles of the injured parties.
